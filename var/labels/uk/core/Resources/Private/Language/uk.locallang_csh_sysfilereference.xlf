				<source>When using the img element, specify a short text alternative with the alt attribute. Note. The value of this attribute is referred to as "alt text".
When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image.</source>
